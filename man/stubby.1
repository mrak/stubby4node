.SH DESCRIPTION
stubby can be invoved either programmatically or through the command line.
Each invocation starts a new instance, given that the supplied port numbers do not overlap.
Three servers are set up: One for reacting to and supplied the configured request and response, respectively.
A second one identical to the first except that it operates over https.
And finally, a third "admin" portal that allows viewing configured data and changing it through RESTful api calls.
